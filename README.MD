### L Brands - Programming interview 

## Overall feedback

Interviewed with: Nick & Rajeesh. 

The interview was more about your ability to memorize computer science theory rather than application development. It was an hour long and consisted of shoot and fire questions rather than investigating your ability to use Golang in production. 

The bulk of the code challenge is made more difficult due to needing to implement a bubble sort from scratch, instead of using the standard library's sort interface. 

This task alone is not difficult, but most programmers have desk references for sorting algorithms, secondly it defeats the purpose of Go's amazing standard library. Which does an amazing job of abstracting away concepts,constants and CS theory so you can focus on developer velocity.


**Programming isn't about your ability to memorize** memory is reconstructive, programming is the ability to translate business logic into programming instructions effectively. If you're going to assign shoot from the hip interview,then it's probably best to give interviewee context before interview happens. 

## Concurrency 

Write a buffered channel then, send and receive from channel. 


## Find Priority String within source string

Given a priority string, find it within the source string. Basically, determine if two strings have the same characters but in different lengths.  

## Find Priority String Within source String, Without Sort

Implement the same challenge as before, but do not use sort interface in Golang 


## Return the two least out of the whole of a slice of ints

Given a slice of ints, return the two smallest values out of the total elements. 


## Questions asked 

Following topics are discussed in the call:

(1) Everyday work duties and responsibilities

(2) Go synchronization

(3) Channels and go routines

(4) mutex and locks

(5) advantages of golang

(6) Challenges faced when using golang

(7) knowledge about some of the golang microservices and rest api frameworks.(Not an in-depth knowledge, just knowing few frameworks may help)

(8) go-kit, gRPC and kafka(used in the project, not sure they will ask about this)
